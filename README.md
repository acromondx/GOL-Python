# GOL-Python
My implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python using Matplotlib and Numpy
The animation updates the grid of cells at each time step according to the rules of the Game of Life and displays the result using the `imshow` function from Matplotlib. The grid of cells is represented as a Numpy array and the state of each cell is determined based on the state of its neighbors, with wraparound behavior for cells on the edge of the grid.
